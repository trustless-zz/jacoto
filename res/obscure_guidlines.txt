first, come up with two main colors, similar to each other
----contrast ratio
b1              :b2                 ~1.04
b1              :b3                 ~1.45
b3              :sb                 ~1.15

----mixing colors
bg = anchor+b1

unread-s = b1

unread-br = b3

anchor-hvr-bcg(-obj) = b1(LIGHT)+box(current), 3 from box

selection(-i) = b1, meet the required contrast-ratio with adobe RGB(!) brightness


---------DARK
----contrast ratio
b1              :box                ~2.60
b2              :box                ~2.70
anchor          :box                =8          // just play with the brightness on b1, I think?
blackout        :blackout-a         =8          // just play with the brightness on anchor, I think?
blackout        :blackout-show      =8
selection(-i)   :high-t             ~4.50       // calculated without opacity

----mixing colors
b3/b4 = b1+box, 4+5 from b1    // explanation: b3/b4 = blend b1 and box with ten midpoints, then pick midpoints 4 and 5 (counting from b1) and blend those with one midpoint.

sb1/sb2 = b1+box, 6 from b1

btn = b1+box, 2+3 from b1 => 3 midpoints, 2 from 3    // explanation: blend b1 and box with ten midpoints, then pick midpoints 2 and 3 (counting from b1) and blend those with three midpoints and pick the second one (counting from 3).

//alternatively(?): anchor-hvr-bcg(-obj) = b1+box, 5+6 from box => 5 from  5

fbb-c = anchor+b1, 5+6 from anchor => 8 midpoints, 3 from 6



---------LIGHT
----contrast ratio
b1              :box                ~2.04
b2              :box                ~2.14
anchor          :box                ~4.82       // just play with the brightness on b1, I think?
blackout        :blackout-a         ~13.28      // just play with the brightness on anchor, I think?
blackout        :blackout-show      ~13.75
selection(-i)   :high-t             ~4.50       // calculated without opacity

----mixing colors
b3/b4 = b1+box, 7 from b1

sb1/sb2 = b1+box, 9 from b1

btn = b1+box, 8 midpoints, 6 from box

fbb-c = adobe HSB(!), b1 set B to 100, adjust S to meet the contrast ratio of 6.5 to fbb-bcg

---------NQD
----contrast ratio
b1              :box                ~2.61
b2              :box                ~2.74

----mixing colors
b3/b4 = b1+box, 5 from b1

sb1/sb2 = b1+box, 6+7 from box

btn = b1+box, 3 from b1

fbb-c = adobe HSB(!), b1 adjust B to meet the contrast ratio of 5 to fbb-bcg
